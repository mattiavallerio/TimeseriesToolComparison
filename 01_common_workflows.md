# Common workflows

**Scope** : UX, UI testing and simple interaction with the tool. Process, production and quality engineers are the target group.

- **Tag(s) search and visualization:**
  - Search multiple tags (by tagname, asset, description, etc…)
  - Change time range
  - Change plot scale (multiple scales…)
  - Zoom in, zoom out
  - Hairline(s)
  - XY plot
  - Overlay, one tag per graph, plots(e.g. Radar or //cord)?
  - Add note or comment to tag
  - Search for comments

- **Shape/pattern search:**
  - Visualize and search for a specific pattern in the data
  - Align patterns
  - Lag one time serie wrt another (manually entered delay or automatically calculated)
  - Search for main contributors for specific pattern

- **Calculated tags:**
  - Filtering, averaging, smoothing
  - Create a new calculated tag
  - Linear/non-linear inference model
  - Autoregression prediction for tags?
  - Calculate statistical variables (e.g. min,max, median, std, etc.) per specified period of time (e.g., hour,day, shift, grade, phase, etc…)

- **Identify events:**
  - Set univariate boundaries
  - Set multivariate boundaries
  - If/ then analysis, if a combination of tags reach a specific set of value identify this with a value
  - Notification?

- **Dashboarding:**
  - Convert an analysis into a dashboard (with real-time data update)
  - Add comment to dashboard to share info and know-how
  - Conditional formatting in the dashboard if a condition is reached (e.g. change color)
  - Notification by email or similar if a condition is reached
  - Daily recap email with predefined dashboard
  - Share dashboard in pdf, jpg or other format
- **Data extraction/Insertion:**
  - Export a dataset after a period selection
  - Export a dataset after a complex selection (e.g. only if a combination of rules applies)
  - Automatically trigger data extraction on a time base (e.g. daily)
  - Write back data to OsiPI

- **Access to online help and documentation**

- **Mobile device friendly?**
